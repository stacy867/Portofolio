            of a software developer.So this portofolio is about who i am and what i do and some projects i previously worked on .Ever since i was a little girl is used to love seeing people playing around with the keyboard and as i grew up i came up realizing
            that i'm passionate about coding and started my journey in coding.I have always loved reading books,watching tv shows and documentaries..actually it is what i do for fun.
